# Mail-chat-Boat

Email bots are Visor.ai‘s new product solution. It’s another option of automation interactions between companies and customers. However, it’s present in the mailbox of your Customer Service.

It came to the public at the beginning of 2020 and, like chatbots, uses Artificial Intelligence.

Tranquilidade is one of Visor.ai’s largest customers. When they heard that we were expanding their solutions, they immediately wanted to be part of this new stage.

The insurer knew that the solution was at an embryonic stage and that it would need improvements.

Since the chatbot worked so well, on both the website and WhatsApp, they weren’t afraid and were excited to invest in Visor.ai solution once more.

That’s how the pilot project came about in partnership with the Portuguese insurance company.
